I wish you good luck as a you start your journey.\n:::\n\n## Welcome üôå\n\nIf you do not already have a `gh-pages` branch, you can create one as follows. First, make sure you have committed all changes to your current working branch with `git status`. Then:\n\n\n```{bash}\ngit checkout --orphan gh-pages\ngit reset --hard # make sure all changes are committed before running this! git commit --allow-empty -m \"Initialising gh-pages branch\" \ngit push origin gh-pages\n```\n\n\n## Goodbye üôå\n\n![](images/paste-1.png)\n\n## See you ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nPlease make sure the file exists and is executable.

Get back to your original repository branch with, for example, `git checkout main`.\n\nAccording to @bharadwaj2021, people have a low life expectancy.\n\nWaga and Sigi made their claim 3 years ago [@chris2011].\n\n### **Ignoring Output**\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that you don‚Äôt need to check your `_site` or `_book` directory into version control (if you have done this in the past you know it makes for very messy diffs!). Before proceeding you should add the output directory of your project to `.gitignore`. For example:\n\n```         \n.gitignore\n```\n\n```         \n/.quarto/ /_site/\n```\n\nIf you‚Äôve already checked these files into source control you may need to remove them explicitly:\n\n```         \nTerminal\n```\n\n```         \ngit rm -r _site\n```\n\n:::: callout-warning\n## Error\n\n**There are various types of error in python code execution:**\n\n-   First error [Google](https://google.com)\n\n-   Second error\n\n    1.

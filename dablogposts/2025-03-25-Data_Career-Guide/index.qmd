## Learn Markdown

Markdown is the `"language"` in which those in the IT world write and communicate. It is a markup language and not a programming language per se. Learning markdown syntax is a very invaluable skill in this field. Even if you don't have any plans on having any data skills, trust me when I tell you it is in your best interest to learn the markdown syntax. If you like the design of this website, then I am happy to let you know that this entire blogpost with its formatting was written in markdown. It can be learnt from between 2 days to about a week. Below are some resources to help you get started using Markdown. Refer to the guide by [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) website for general and detailed information about what you can use markdown for.

## Import Important Libraries

To get started on this journey, here is a skeleton of all the important Python libraries/modules you need to import. I have created this code to prevent having to type out the same codes from scratch for every project.

Feel free to modify and use it as you wish. I will also be updating the code regularly, whenever I add contents to this EduTechTainMent Data Career Resources and Guide.

Steps Download the file via this LINK. Save the file in a convenient location, preferably a cloud storage directory you can access remotely on any device you are connected to. I would strongly recommend [Koofr](https://k00.fr/fywszbgp), which gives you 5 to 10Gb storage space and allows you to connect and sync your files seamlessly across multiple devices- desktop PC, laptops, android mobile phones, as well as connect and sync files from other popular cloud storages such as Google Drive, OneDrive, and DropBox. It aslo supprots WebDav. I use Koofr seamlessly across about 3 laptops, 2 desktop PCs and 1 android smartphone. I can access all my files from all these devices from anywhere in the world, and I don’t get restricted by location.

Load the file into your Jupyter notebook by running the code below without the quotation marks.

```{python}
#| eval: false
%load “path_to_the_import_packages.py_file”
```

For example, this is the path to my file on my PC: `load C:\Users\Admin\Koofr\import_packages.py`

Finally, run the cell on your Jupyter notebook.

## How do I Learn if Can’t Afford a Decent Specs Laptop or Don’t have a Personal Laptop or Desktop Computer?

Are you constrained by lack of a decent specification laptop or even desktop computer system? Don’t sweat !!! EduTechTainMent has got you covered. You can utilize the following methods to have access to a platform to learn and pratice your Data skills:

1.  [DataLab by DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/717f06a7-567c-4956-b2d7-7856a3e50f26/edit)
2.  [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/explore): The [Education plan](https://deepnote.com/docs/edu-verification) gives you all the benefits of the team Plan at no cost. You can also get the free version if you don’t have an educational institution email account. Use your mobile phone (read how to do that below).
3.  [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
4.  Make use of your mobile phone as a last resort. Although its not the best, user-experience wise, it at least enables you to get started practicing without the need to procrastinate due to unavailability of a laptop computer. I will be sharing a guide on how to use you smartphone for this purpose soon. Just stay tuned.

If you do not already have a `gh-pages` branch, you can create one as follows. First, make sure you have committed all changes to your current working branch with `git status`. Then:

```{bash}
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git reset --hard # make sure all changes are committed before running this! git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialising gh-pages branch" 
git push origin gh-pages
```

## Goodbye üôå

Please make sure the file exists and is executable. According to Did you intend 'assign' as a Lua filter in an extension? If so, make sure you've spelled the name of the extension correctly.

The original Pandoc error follows below. Error running filter

Double-check that the last `git push` action has indeed set the **Settings** : **Pages** for your repository as expected in the previous figure. Get back to your original repository branch with, for example, `git checkout main`.

According to @bharadwaj2021, people have a low life expectancy.

Waga and Sigi made their claim 3 years ago [@chris2011].

### **Ignoring Output**

It‚Äôs important to note that you don‚Äôt need to check your `_site` or `_book` directory into version control (if you have done this in the past you know it makes for very messy diffs!). Before proceeding you should add the output directory of your project to `.gitignore`. For example:

```         
.gitignore
```

```         
/.quarto/ /_site/
```

If you‚Äôve already checked these files into source control you may need to remove them explicitly:

```         
Terminal
```

```         
git rm -r _site
```

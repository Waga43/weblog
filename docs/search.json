    "text": "About Me\nI am Abdulwasiu Bamidele Popoola, a health professional with a passion for ICT. I am a self-taught web developer, and data professional. I have chosen to focus more on Artificial Intelligence and its varied applications in the healthcare industry. Given the current pervasive nature of AI, I hope to be able to contribute, in my own little way, to the AI landscape in my country and the globe at large. I am a passionate learner and show utmost dedication and grit when I put my mind to learning a skill. As a result I sought to become a self-taught data scientist by starting out as a data analyst. This will serve to equip me with the necessary analytical skills to succeed in data science. I believe learning is a step-wise but life-long process. Over the years I have worked to gather the requisite soft and technical skills to make me succeed in this endeavour. Given the importance of domain knowledge and expertise, I believe my wealth of experience in healthcare, better positions me to perform as an excellent health analyst and ultimately a data scientist.\nA.B. Popoola is the immediate past Director of Health Services, University Health Services, Federal University Dutse (FUD). He is also an adjunct Lecturer, Dept. of Human Physiology, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine and Allied Medical Sciences, FUD.

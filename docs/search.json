    "text": "About Me\nI am Abdulwasiu Bamidele Popoola, a health professional with a passion for ICT. I am a self-taught web developer, and data professional. I have chosen to focus more on Artificial Intelligence and its varied applications in the healthcare industry. Given the current pervasive nature of AI, I hope to be able to contribute, in my own little way, to the AI landscape in my country and the globe at large. I am a passionate learner and show utmost dedication and grit when I put my mind to learning a skill. As a result I sought to become a self-taught data scientist by starting out as a data analyst. This will serve to equip me with the necessary analytical skills to succeed in data science. I believe learning is a step-wise but life-long process. Over the years I have worked to gather the requisite soft and technical skills to make me succeed in this endeavour. Given the importance of domain knowledge and expertise, I believe my wealth of experience in healthcare, better positions me to perform as an excellent health analyst and ultimately a data scientist.\nA.B. Popoola is the immediate past Director of Health Services, University Health Services, Federal University Dutse (FUD). He is also an adjunct Lecturer, Dept. of Human Physiology, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine and Allied Medical Sciences, FUD. He is a Google Certified Data Analyst, took part in the Hamoye Data Science Fellowships ’22 and ’24, a DLYA certified in Data Science and Machine Learning, an ALX-T Udacity Certified Data Analyst, I4GxZuri Full Stack Software Developer, IBM Certified in Python for Data Science and AI, a McKinsey Forward Alumnus, INCO Certified in Green Digital Skills, DataCamp Certified in AI Fundamentals, DataCamp Certified in AI Literacy, Udacity Certified in AWS Machine Learning Foundations.\nA. B. Popoola is a member of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Member, Blacks in Technology, Nigeria and a Member, Data Science Network (DSN). I am also a DataCamp Classrooms Ambassador, Federal University Dutse and sole administrator of DataCamp Classrooms scholarships at FUD, mentoring, teaching and administering DataCamp scholarships to students of the university to help them gain globally relevant data skills. In addition, I am also a data mentor to many other students, and staff members, both within and outside the university. I have a passion to teach, impart knowledge and network with like minds both in health sector and the IT domain. Thus I Founded EduTechTainMent Ltd (ETTM), an EdTech company that is involved in leveraging the use of technology in education and is the developer and administrator of EduTechTainMent forum, EduTechTainMent Learning Management System and EduTechTainMent YouTube channel.\nI am also a member of the team that won a TETFund grant to develop an AI powered system to revolutionize medical education in Nigeria (powered by Anatomia Ltd.)"
